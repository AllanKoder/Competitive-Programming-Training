## Mistakes

- Too complex answers
- Using patches or quick fixes
- Recursion

## Learnings

- When there is a found edge case, try to generalize
- If you can, rephrase the question in an easier way, or rephrase your solution easier
    - Problem F could've had the solved easier if I had sorted in reverse
- When you have an answer, such as the one for G. Just stop looking at the code, and start visualizing 
    - I could've had a much easier solution if I just had tried to look harder and relax
- Debugging and thinking out loud is a great help 
    - Rubber ducking is a great assistance
- Stay and stick with a problem for learning and don't use any external help until much later.
- Noticing every line of ambiguity, or unknown code is a liability. 
    - Stay with the details
